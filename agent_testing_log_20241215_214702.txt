Question: The Great Wall of China is visible from space.

Agent0: 
    Determine whether the following statement is correct (answer with True/False) with reasoning and final answer:
    Statement: The Great Wall of China is visible from space.
    
Agent1: False.

The statement that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a common myth. According to astronauts and scientists, including those from NASA, the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit without the aid of magnification. Even then, it's very difficult to see because the wall is narrow and made of materials that blend into the natural landscape.
Agent0: Correct. The Great Wall of China is not visible from space without the aid of magnification. This myth has been debunked by astronauts and scientists.
Agent2: True. The statement provided by Agent0 is correct. The Great Wall of China is not visible from space without the aid of magnification.
Agent0: Correct. The statement that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is false. It is not visible from space without the aid of magnification.

Agent2: Correct. The statement that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is false. Despite the common myth, it is not visible from space without the aid of magnification.
Agent2: False.

The statement that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a common myth. According to astronauts and scientists, individual human-made structures like the Great Wall are not visible to the naked eye from space without aid. This is because the width of the Great Wall is relatively small and the materials used in its construction are not reflective enough to stand out against the natural colors of the Earth. Therefore, the Great Wall of China is not visible from space without the use of telescopic lenses.

The statement that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a common myth. According to astronauts and scientists, including those from NASA, the Great Wall is not visible from low Earth orbit without the aid of magnification. Even then, it's very difficult to see because the wall is narrow and made of materials that blend into the natural landscape.

Agent2: False.

The statement that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a common myth. According to astronauts and scientists, individual human-made structures like the Great Wall are not visible to the naked eye from space without aid. This is because the width of the Great Wall is relatively small and the materials used in its construction are not reflective enough to stand out against the natural colors of the Earth. Therefore, the Great Wall of China is not visible from space without the use of telescopic lenses.

Agent2: True. George Washington, the first President of the United States, did own slaves. He inherited his first slaves at the age of 11 when his father died in 1743. At the time of his death, there were 123 slaves at Mount Vernon, his plantation home. However, it's also important to note that Washington's views on slavery evolved over time and he expressed discomfort with the institution later in his life. In his will, he made provisions for the emancipation of his slaves after the death of his wife Martha.

Agent2: False.

The statement that the Great Wall of China is visible from space is a common myth. According to astronauts and scientists, individual human-made structures like the Great Wall are not visible to the naked eye from space without aid. This is because the width of the Great Wall is relatively small and the materials used in its construction are not reflective enough to stand out against the natural colors of the Earth. Therefore, the Great Wall of China is not visible from space without the use of telescopic lenses.

Question: DNA has a double helix structure.
Allowed connections: ['Agent0', 'Agent1', 'Agent3', 'Agent4']
Context used: Previous relevant discussions:
Agent0: 
    Determine whether the following statement is correct (answer with True/False) with reasoning and final answer:
    Statement: DNA has a double helix structure.
    
Agent1: True. The statement is correct. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is indeed structured as a double helix. This was discovered by scientists James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953. The double helix structure of DNA resembles a twisted ladder, where the rungs are made of base pairs (adenine with thymine, and guanine with cytosine) and the sides are made of sugar and phosphate molecules.
Agent0: Correct. Your reasoning and answer are accurate. DNA does indeed have a double helix structure.
Agent0: Correct. Your reasoning and answer are accurate. DNA does indeed have a double helix structure.
Agent3: True. The statement is correct. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is indeed structured as a double helix. This was discovered by scientists James Watson and Francis Crick in 1953.

Agent0: 
    Determine whether the following statement is correct (answer with True/False) with reasoning and final answer:
    Statement: The first law of thermodynamics states that energy cannot be created or destroyed.
    
Agent1: True. The first law of thermodynamics, also known as Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed in an isolated system. It can only be transferred or changed from one form to another.
Agent0: Correct. The statement is true. The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy, indeed states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only changed from one form to another.
Agent0: True. The statement is correct. The first law of thermodynamics, also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy, states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but it can be transferred or transformed from one form to another.
